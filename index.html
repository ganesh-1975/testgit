      <h1>Git Commands and their uses</h1>

      <p>
        <b>Git</b> is a version control system which needs to be installed in
        our machines to keep track of the code file changes and later save them
        on a remote repository like Github or Bigbucket.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>git init</b>
          <p>
            It is used to intialize git to do version control for our project in
            our working directory.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git --version</b>
          <p>It is used to check the git version installed in our system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</b>
          <p>
            It is used to set the user email id which is used as identification
            while commiting the code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</b>
          <p>
            It is used to set the user name which is used as identification
            while commiting the code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git status</b>
          <p>
            It is used to know the sattus of our code files like whether they
            are untracked,staged or commited.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git add [filename]</b>
          <p>
            It is used to stage the untracked code file. Means the file from the
            working directory is moved to the staging area where this file is
            held for its changes to be commited to local repository.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git add .</b>
          <p>It will add i.e. stage all the code files to the staging area.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git commit -m "[message]"</b>
          <p>
            It is used to commit the staged changes to the local repository with
            a -m option where the message is given to identify the recent
            changes. Basically we are making a log of the changes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git log</b>
          <p>It is used to check the list of commits we have done so far.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git reset --hard [SHA number]</b>
          <p>
            [SHA number is the secured hash algorithm number which is unique for
            each commit.] It is used to delete the recent commit change and go
            back to the previous commit working code represented by that
            particular commit's SHA.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git reset --soft [SHA number]</b>
          <p>
            It is used to go back to the previous commited code along with the
            latest code change still available.The git log will only show
            previous commited logs but the recent commited log will not be there
            even though the change in this commit will be still available.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git remote add origin [url]</b>
          <p>
            It is used to set the origin location on remote repository where the

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git branch -M main</b>
          <p>This sets the branch name as main</p>

        <li>
          <b>git push -u origin main</b>
          <p>
            It is used to push the code from local to remote at the specified

            fetches the code from remote and git merge which merges any new

        <li>

        <li>
          <b>git branch [branchname]</b>
          <p>It is used to create a branch with the mentioned branch name .</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>git checkout branchname</b>
          <p>
            It is used to check out from current branch and move on to the

          </p>

        <li>
          <b>git merge branchname</b>
          <p>
            It is used to merge the new changes done in the mentioned branchname
